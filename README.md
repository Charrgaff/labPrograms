# labPrograms
Programs for handling protein sequences and identifiers.

The programs themselves are all heavily commented. However, I will also put up some example files since the input formats can be confusing.

A general rule is that all inputs/output files are .csv or .txt. 

Several of the programs utilize tools from the EMBOSS suite: http://emboss.sourceforge.net/
